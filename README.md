# FollowersTools
Python scripts to manage your Instagram account. One script to generate a list of everyone who doesn't follow you back, and another script to automatically unfollow them.

[Firefox must be installed and configured to use with Selenium]
[Temporary restrictions may be placed on your account for unfollowing too quickly]
[All locally processed, check the source code to confirm. Don't run if you don't understand or doubt security]

# Instagram Followers.py 
Checks a chosen Instagram account's followers and following and generates .txt files for both. 
Then compares the files and generates a third "scum.txt" file of accounts who don't follow back.

# Unfollower
Iterates through a .txt file of Instagram accounts and unfollows them.
You can use the .txt files generated by Instagram Followers.py as input and immediately unfollow everyone who doesn't follow you back.
Use confidures speed options to avoid Instagram limiting your account.
~40 unfollows per hour seems to be the sweet spot.
